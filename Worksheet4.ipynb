    "- In the dataset, there are 243 countries. To save running time, you should select a subset of countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, you are also allowed to select a specific time range since the dataset contains a long time range. Please make sure that your selection is not empty, otherwise your plot is empty.\n",

    "- To receive full credits, your code/result should meet the following requirements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "     - You should select at least 2 countries to produce your plot.\n",
    "     - You should create animation for this part. Scatter plot and bar plot are accepted. You can also show histogram or line plot.\n",
    "     - Write a short paragraph to describe what you did for data processing (e.g which countries you select or time range you select).\n"
